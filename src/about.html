        <h3>Club Purpose</h3>
        <p>	The purpose of the machine learning club is to harness
            students curiosity about artificial intelligence and 
            teach them valuable programming skills that they can 
            apply in whatever field they choose to pursue in life. 
            Machine learning is on the rise, and is being applied 
            to cutting edge research and industry. Bronx Science 
            has a strong focus on STEM, and machine learning is an
            increasingly important part of a good STEM education. 
            The machine learning club will strengthen students coding
            abilities as well as their math skills, increasing their
            chances of success in advanced STEM courses. Most 
            importantly the ML club will teach students how to think
            critically about a variety of problems, igniting their
            curiosity and passion for science.
